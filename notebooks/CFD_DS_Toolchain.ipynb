    "# Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "We will set up a workbench familiar to a Data Science person for working with large numbers of CFD datasets indexed by parameters. We will allow these parameters to control the shapes themselves, CFD algorithmic parameters, or hyperparameters for optimization and summary.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Space\n",
    "\n",
    "This is intended for cases which may be naturally indexed by some reasonable number - say 1 to 100 - of parameters - these will be the \"input sample\" columns in our data frame. One fully populated row of these parameters should be a neccessary and sufficient condition to run and analyze a single simulation. We will start with non-transient problems, but this is only for initial simplicity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution Space\n",
    "The outputs should be available for any completed simulation (row of the DF), and will be the \"output columns\" of our dataframe.  Note that this can and should include not only physical metrics (like lift and drag) but computational ones (like run time or stability).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "We set up a tool chain of everything required to take an input row and generate an output row, from parametric CAD and meshing through CFD simulation, analysis, and aggregation. We begin using Open Source tools anyone can run on a personal computer, then later explore more aggressive (and non-free in all senses) environments."
