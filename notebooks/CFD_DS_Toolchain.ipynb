    "# Introduction and Context\n",
    "![partially folded paper with geometry on it](folded_paper.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Physics simulation is powerful but has a lot of moving parts. Data science tooling - and notebooks in particular -  are a rich way to orchestrate computational workflows, explore complex data spaces, and illuminate the resultant narratives. Our goal here is to provide a working example of one such workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "~~Chocolate, meet Peanut Butter. You folks are going to get along great.~~\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular,  A live Jupyter notebook is a wonderful primary interface for a simple workflow in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Beyond access to third party tools for problem specific computations and tasks it provides a central workbench to relate and process data in a familiar, consistent way using standard tools and approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstate a simple version of this claim, we will create and explore a simple parametric design space where a few numbers will characterize the geometric design and physical context of a paper airplane. \n",
    "Using simulation data we will explore some of these parameters to understand how the way we fold and throw the airplane may affect its flight performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "~~We will set up a workbench familiar to a Data Science practitioner for working with (large) numbers of CFD datasets indexed by parameters. We will allow these parameters to control the shapes themselves, CFD algorithmic parameters, or hyperparameters for optimization and summary. This involves two favorite DS tools: we will center our work on a Dataframe whose rows represent samples in some design and simulation space, and we will use Jupyter notebooks as the primary interface to the entire design and simulation process. That is, work with creating the geometry, moving the camera around for visualization, and configuring the simulation will be done done in the notebook rather than external tools. ~~\n",
    "\n",
    "~~This is of course not ideal for many situations: dedicated CAD/CFD/analysis programs are vastly better for doing real work. The hope is that this approach is useful for a certain type of problem and user, and satisies our desire to use a minimal amount of tooling - we can of course swap in richer dedicated tools as needed to improve this generic workflow in specific ways later.~~\n",
    "\n",
    "With the ability to view ensembles of physical simulations as classic dataframes, we will do some of the things one normally does with dataframes. We will build models to interpolate and predict, we will use those models to optimize and analyse, and we will explore how to construct the dataframe for a given problem in the most efficient and efficaceous way. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can naturally partition this work into three sections:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A Workflow for a Single Simulation\n",
    " - Geometry\n",
    " - Meshing\n",
    " - Simulation\n",
    " - analysis\n",
    "* Dataframe centered Simulation Ensembles\n",
    " - Dataframes\n",
    " - Computation\n",
    " - Persistence\n",
    "* CFD Ensemble Centered Applications\n",
    " - Surrogate Models and Estimation\n",
    " - AeroDBs (precomputed ensembles)\n",
    " - Optimization\n",
    " \n",
    "The \"Colophon\" section describes the specific tools we use and how they are integrated so we treat them as abtracted \"black boxes\" in much of the remainder.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Audience\n",
    "\n",
    "This article is likely most useful for two types of reader:  \n",
    "* comfortable with data science tools with a basic knowledge or interest in physics simulation\n",
    "* physics simulation practitioners wanting to use common datascience tools in their work. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will treat the actual simulation as something of a \"black box\": to us a given simulation run is just one mapping from the input space to the output space among many. Making this simulation achieve an optimal balance between cost and accuracy (of various sorts) is of course a deep area of expertise, involves problem specific understanding, and is beyond our scope here.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Space\n",
    "\n",
    "This is intended for ensembles of simulations which may be naturally indexed by some reasonable number - say 1 to 100 - of parameters. These parameters will be columns in our data frame, along with any other configuration and physical data needed to run and analyze a single simulation. While we will focus on \"interesting\" parameters and a structured design space, the data frame can certainly just comprise an unstructured set of simulations but the output space should be consistent and comparable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start with non-transient problems, but this is only for initial simplicity. We can easily add time indexing to this workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution Space\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The full solution data should be available, but our data frame will only contain specific extracted outputs and metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculated outputs and objective functions will be available for any completed simulation and will be added to the columns of our dataframe.  Note that this includes not only physical metrics (like lift and drag) but computational ones (like run time or stability). References to the full raw solution allows us to extend and recalculate these outputs or create new ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# A CFD Workflow for a Single Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin by setting up the tools and models to run a single standalone simulation and analyze its results. We will use the following python and other executables. See the `README` or the individual `lightningcatcher_*` files for installation notes."

    "\n",
    "For our example we will model a standard paper airplane as descibed [in Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_plane).\n",
    "\n",
    "~~This affords a simple geometry we can perform with only \"fold\" and \"reflect\" operations implementable with any constructive solid geometry tool.~~\n",
    "\n",
    "This simple design starts with folding a paper length-wise. Then we make three repeated folds of the current front wing corner in to the center line. The last of these creates the wing surface, and can be varied to provide an interesting geometric parameter for our design space. That is, what we have annotated as $\\phi$ on this  diagram:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Wikipedia-sourced Plane Param](plane_param_diagram.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "This $\\phi$ will be a primary input parameter alongside the angle of attack: the \"tilt\" with which the airplane moves through the air ~~since this is controlled by the thrower and interacts with the flight performance~~.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our output parameters will represent the aerodynamic performance of a given design in terms of Lift and Drag or their ratio. We can compare our simulation output against analytical and ground truth results using [existing work](http://www.lactea.ufpr.br/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/On_the_Aerodynamics_of_Paper_Airplanes.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "~~Let's begin with the constructive geometry build for the geometry itself. We'll go into most of this in another notebook (here, if you're interested), for now we're just going to set some of the parameters we'll care about, and make sure we can generate a 3D model file for our plane. Note that we will for now generate a separate model file for each value of any design parameters, rather than encoding the parameter into the CAD outpput so it can be modified directly. This has an additional benefit in that it decouples the geometry, meshing, and simulation stages, allowing more flexibility with which tools are used. Obviously, some neat things are possible if these stages are communicating: simulation results may help improve our meshing, for example. But for now, we will stick with the large design loop from geometric parameters (Phi and Theta, or \"fuselage_rads\" and \"angle_of_attack\") though simple physical outputs - namely Drag and Lift.~~\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many other parameters we can explore - you will see some below where define all the model variables - but these two provide an interesting but managable design space to explore.\n",
    "\n",
    "~~For now, we want We begin instantiating and visualizing the geometry, using `gmsh` for both.~~ Our design space includes a lot of things we likely won't vary: the size of the paper, the final \"camber\" angle of the wings, etc. We encode them all in a dict, with some algorithm and visualization parameters too for convenience. You will not be misled if you think of this as a row in a dataframe, or an input point in a sample space, but we won't do so here just yet. For now, we'll use a single config for geometric, algorithmic, and visualization parameters to take a single example conf from geometry through analysis."

As a first step toward building our own visualizations using `matplotlib` and standard DS tools, let's open up the surface flow CSV file we generate for each sim and extract global physics data."

    "Often we're concerned with a set of related simulation runs. How should we consider this element and set? A Data Science person might like to consider a single simulation as a row in a dataframe; a CFD practitioner might think of it as an element of a DOE; a designer may just have a bunch of experimenal runs to compare and relate.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's nice sometimes to think of CFD simulation runs as simply another mapping from an input space to an output space. We may have multiple ways to construct this mapping - for instance: different algorithmic parameters and entire algorithms, precise vs fast CFD and even non-CFD estimates, even experimental data. So rows in the input space will not have unique images in the output space unless we include the mapping used as an input. It can be useful to seperate physical inputs (air temperature), design inputs (fuselage angle), model inputs (mesh size), and algorithmic ones (CFD, linear solver), but here we want to keep things as simple as possible so we'll keep all the inputs \"flat\" for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each row of our dataframe will contain everything needed to run and analyze a single simulation - a sample from our input space. There may be template files and mesh files which are not part of the dataframe, generally platform specific, but everything needed to generate and use these files will be columns in our dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We want a dataframe with the input part of every row populated with interesting values. Then for a given mapping we can generate the outputs. We begin by specifying all the static parameters and then varying a subset - the DOE parameters, or a sampling method in the input space, or a set of values of interest. In this case, we will vary the `fuselage_rad` alone - then with `angle of attack` in a simple grid:\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll uses a  function to add columns to the dataframe for our project, which can involve any of:\n",
    "* run CFD simulation\n",
    "* extract values from previously run simulation\n",
    "* apply estimations (surrogate models) to generate values\n",
    "* generate sumary and visualization data\n",

The sharp dip suggests something interesting - very likely, a bug in our geometry code; most likely, the naively simple simulation approach creating unphysical behaviors; or least likely, an actual critical point of some kind in the physics. \n",

It's useful because a number of simulation tools tend to take this configuration file approach and because it makes it's easier to, for example, pull a directory of image files into a movie with `ffmpeg` than to sort out a live interface for doing so. It also makes it easy to decouple components - we try to use light interfaces, so switching CFD engines or visualization should be mostly independent of the high level workflow. It is certainly possible to use direct API when it makes sense, as we do for interacting with constructive solid geometry for example.\n",

    "### Workbench - which tools will we use?\n",
    "\n",
    "The tools for this articleare as few and as free as possible. However, we try to keep the tool-specific details as easily changed as possible - later articles will explore more complex cases, tools that are more focused and not free, and larger scale parallel computation, so we want to make that easy down the road.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fundamentally, we work with Python Notebooks as a way to elegantly tie together multiple tools and platforms into coherent workflow, orchestrate computation, and analyze results.\n",

    "#### Dataframes and ML\n",
    "We want to have a familiar way to work with arrays of data and tools for processing them.\n",
    "\n",
    "A primary goal here is to treat the exploration of a design space as simply mapping problem parameters to objective functions. That is, we'd like to take some geometry and simulation configuration values (input vector) and map them to some estimated physical/computational results (output vector). Note that this is classic Data Science, and so we'd like to keep a DataFrame (Pandas, for now) at the center of our work.\n",

    "#### Geometry and Model\n",
    "We use `gmsh` for both Parametric CAD and our Meshing. The python interface makes this pleasant-ish We will explore varying geometric parameters by rebuilding geometries and then meshes for different values. We will generate `gmsh` output files as well as....\n",

    "#### Analysis\n",
    "We will aggregate the tabular outputs from SU2 and process them using Pandas, Numpy, and other common DS tools.\n",

    "Given a fully populated DOEFrame fit a simple model and optimize that."
